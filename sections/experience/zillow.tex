\textbf{Senior Software Engineer} \hfill July 2023 - Present\\
Zillow Group, Inc. \hfill \textit{Seattle, WA}

Leading the transformation of Zillowâ€™s MLS data and product DevOps team into a self-service compute platform for >200 engineers. Our team of three owns and manages the cloud infrastructure, networking, observability, pipelines, tooling, and automation that empowers our customer teams with seamless operations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set clear team goals, roadmap and milestones for 6 months to 1 year with deadlines and accountability owners. Defined the on-call policy, the service and project design process (lightweight RFC), rewrote and improved internal and customer onboarding documentation.
    \item Developed pipeline tooling to improve the reliability and UX of writing and deploying services; implemented post-apply feedback mechanisms for customers to easily debug failing deployments without our intervention.
    \item Consolidated many disparate repos into fewer purpose built monorepos  (services and tooling, infrastructure, tenant resources) making development and dependency maintenance faster and easier.
\end{itemize}
