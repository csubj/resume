\textbf{Senior Software Engineer} \hfill July 2023 - Present\\
Zillow Group, Inc. \hfill \textit{Seattle, WA}

Leading the transformation of Zillowâ€™s MLS data and product DevOps team into a self-service compute platform for >200 engineers. Our team of three owns and manages the cloud infrastructure, networking, observability, CICD, tooling, and automation that empowers our product teams with seamless operations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed the 1 year roadmap to align with company and org leadership needs while also addressing tech debt priorities. Defined the on-call, tenant support, and engagement policies; created a design process (lightweight RFC), rewrote and improved internal onboarding documentation.
    \item Created tooling to deploy services that reduced bad kubernetes deployments due to configuration errors by 20\%, which also gives post-apply feedback for tenants to easily debug without intervention.
    \item Rewrote EKS cluster definitions and cluster bootstrap process, added functionality to allow for ephemeral compute and easier A/B testing with our kubernetes stack and faster iteration on platform changes, disaster recovery and kubernetes version upgrades.
\end{itemize}
